In 2008, I was just started my high school.
It was my first time to see a net-disk product called 163pan.com.
It said to promise to store file eternally.

Therefore, I uploaded all my collections of my Original SoundTrack (OST) files to this web service,
and I thought it would be very handy to build a search tool.
That's why this tool exists.

However, at that time, I just started coding for a little bit while.
My coding styles were really naive.

This repo is just a copy of my codes.
